Bodoke CSS
==========

### Still at development.
###### Current versión: Beta 0.1.5 (Amon Fabian)


Bodoke is a CSS/SCSS Front-end Framework created for supporting multiple grids in a single project and with a minimum of own design. Is visually clean for you to design with your own custom identity.

His base idea is to be responsive and not visualy contaminated. 
It supports desktop, mobile and tablet websites using semantic clases in html.
