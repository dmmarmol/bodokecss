==========

### Still at development.
###### Current versi√≥n: Beta 0.3.1 (Caesar Odysseus)


Bodoke is a CSS/SCSS Front-end Framework created for supporting multiple grids in a single project with a minimum of custom design. Is visually clean for you to design with your own custom identity.

The base idea of this project is to be responsive and not visualy contaminated.
It supports desktop, mobile and tablet websites using semantic clases in html.
