Bodoke CSS
==========

### Still at development.
###### Last release: [0.5.51 (Eagle NadÃ­m)](https://github.com/dmmarmol/bodokecss/releases/tag/0.5.51)


Bodoke it's a CSS Front-end Framework created with SASS/SCSS, made for supporting multiple grids in a single project with a minimum of custom design.
It's a layout starter project nice and ready for you to design with your own custom identity.

*BodokeCSS* was born as a testing project where i can try any new CSS feature and practice the [CSSOOP](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) model.

The base idea of this project is to be responsive and not visualy contaminated.
It supports desktop, mobile and tablet websites using semantic clases in html.

## Support
* IE >= 8
* Firefox >= 30
* Chrome >= 34
* Safari >= 7
* Opera >= 23
* IOS >= 7
* Android >= 4.4
* Blackberry browser >= 10

## How it works?

The `.container` class is the one whe keeps the content centered and makes your site look beautiful. You need to place it right after the `body` tag if you want to prevent the content from touching the viewport.

Then you can put as many `.row`s as you want inside the `.container` and it's mandatory that you put at least one `.col` (or `.column/.columns/.cols`) inside of each one of them.

Set the column width using the column-size classes (eg: `.c6-12` will make that block fill half of the `.row` available space)
``` html
<body>
	<main class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="c6-12 cols">Half row content</div>
			<div class="c6-12 cols">Half row content</div>
		</div>
	</main>
</body>
```

Project docs coming soon... But if you are brave enough, you can check the code for yourself (it's self documented!)

## Getting Started

You need to have previously installed [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

#### Install via npm
```sh
npm install --save bodokecss
```

#### Clone it
Clone the `bodokecss` from your `node_modules` folder into your **assets** or **scss** folder (preferably `scss/`) but it will depend on your project structure

-------------

## Integrate Bodoke into your site

### 1) Link into your html
```html
<head>
	<title>Bodoke Rocks \m/</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/bodoke.css">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- What does 'Bodoke' means?, what was this guy thinking? -->
</body>
```

### 2) Include into your sass flow

*Assuming your site structure it's something like this:*
```
/project
|-- *.html
|-- *.php
|-- /node_modules
    |-- bodokecss --> Copy this folder
|-- /src
    |-- css
    |-- js
    |-- images
|-- /scss
    |-- bodokecss --> And paste it here
    |   |-- app.scss
```

Then at the top of your main scss (eg. `app.scss`) file include the next line:

```scss
@import "build/src/bodoke";
```
You can easily customize or expand Bodoke inside `build/src/bodoke.scss` by commenting or uncommenting each `@import` component. *I do not recommend to uncomment the items before 5. (Compnents)*.

-------------

## Compile SCSS files

#### Using Gulp

To make this work, you need to have already installed **[node](http://blog.diegomarmol.com.ar/getting-started-with-node-js-and-gulp-js/)** and **[gulp](http://blog.diegomarmol.com.ar/getting-started-with-node-js-and-gulp-js/)**

If you are a gulp user copy and paste this `task` into your `gulpfile.js` *(see: [blog.diegomarmol.com.ar](http://blog.diegomarmol.com.ar/getting-started-with-node-js-and-gulp-js/))*

After Node was installed, run:
```sh
npm install gulp gulp-sass gulp-autoprefixer --save-dev
```

```js
var gulp 			= require('gulp');
var sass 			= require('gulp-sass');
var autoprefixer 	= require('gulp-autoprefixer');

gulp.task('bdk', function () {
    gulp.src( '.scss/**/*.scss' ) // Set this according the route to your project
		.pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
		.pipe(autoprefixer({
            browsers: AUTOPREFIXER_BROWSERS,
            cascade: false
        }))
		.pipe(gulp.dest( './path/to/your/css/folder' ));
});
```

Now Open the **Terminal** or **CMD**, run `gulp bdk` and your CSS will be up and running!
