# Lib Extension

If you have to override a section of any vendor/lib, I recommend you have an 8th folder called `lib-extensions/` in which you may have files named exactly after the lib they overwrite. For instance, `lib-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
